## sh Runner

### Description
This Docker project enables the secure execution of shell (.sh) scripts within an isolated container. It is ideal for running backup and maintenance scripts and includes built-in cron job support for reliable, scheduled task automation.

### Requirements
* docker
* Docker Compose (recommended)

### using dev example 
```bash
 sh-runner:
    container_name: sh-runner
    build: .
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pgrep cron" ]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    environment:
      EXECUTE_ON_RUN: "true"  # Execute scripts immediately on container startup (default: false)
      CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 2 * * *"  # Run scripts daily at 02:00
    volumes:
      - ./logger:/logger
      - ./scripts-example:/sh-scripts

```
### using prod example 
```bash
  sh-runner:
    image: muhaimeed/sh-runner:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: [ "CMD-SHELL", "pgrep cron" ]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
    environment:
      EXECUTE_ON_RUN: "true" # Execute scripts immediately on container startup (default: false)
      CRON_SCHEDULE: "0 2 * * *" # Run scripts daily at 02:00
    volumes:
      - ./logger:/logger
      - ./scripts-example:/sh-scripts

```
### Volumes

* /sh-scripts – Directory containing shell scripts to be executed
* /logger – Directory for logs generated by executed scripts

### Environment Variables

1. **EXECUTE_ON_RUN**
If set to true, scripts will run immediately when the container starts.
2. **CRON_SCHEDULE**
Cron expression that defines when scripts should be executed.
